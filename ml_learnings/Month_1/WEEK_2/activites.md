let's implement simple linear regression from scratch in Python. We'll use gradient descent to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) cost function.

```python
import numpy as np

class LinearRegression:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, n_iterations=1000):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.n_iterations = n_iterations
        self.weights = None
        self.bias = None

    def fit(self, X, y):
        # Initialize weights and bias
        n_samples, n_features = X.shape
        self.weights = np.zeros(n_features)
        self.bias = 0

        # Gradient descent
        for _ in range(self.n_iterations):
            # Predicted values
            y_pred = np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias

            # Compute gradients
            dw = (1 / n_samples) * np.dot(X.T, (y_pred - y))
            db = (1 / n_samples) * np.sum(y_pred - y)

            # Update weights and bias
            self.weights -= self.learning_rate * dw
            self.bias -= self.learning_rate * db

    def predict(self, X):
        return np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample data
    X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
    y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

    # Create and train the model
    model = LinearRegression(learning_rate=0.01, n_iterations=1000)
    model.fit(X, y)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X)
    print("Predictions:", y_pred)
```

This implementation defines a `LinearRegression` class with methods for fitting the model and making predictions. It uses gradient descent to update the weights and bias iteratively to minimize the MSE cost function. Finally, it demonstrates how to use the implemented linear regression model with sample data.



Certainly! Scikit-learn provides a convenient and efficient way to implement linear regression. Here's how you can use it:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X)
print("Predictions:", y_pred)
```

In this example:

- We import `LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`.
- We define our sample data `X` (features) and `y` (target).
- We create an instance of the `LinearRegression` model.
- We train the model using the `fit()` method with our data.
- Finally, we use the `predict()` method to make predictions on the same data `X`.

Scikit-learn takes care of all the underlying details like gradient descent and optimization, making it simple to use for implementing linear regression and other machine learning models.





Great idea! Let's use the Boston Housing Dataset, which is available in scikit-learn, to practice linear regression. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
import numpy as np

# Load the Boston Housing Dataset
boston = load_boston()
X = boston.data
y = boston.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
print("R-squared Score:", r2)
```

In this code:

- We load the Boston Housing Dataset using `load_boston()` function from scikit-learn.
- We split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()` function.
- We create an instance of the `LinearRegression` model and train it on the training data using `fit()` method.
- We make predictions on the test set using `predict()` method.
- Finally, we evaluate the model's performance using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared score. 

This code gives you a basic example of how to use linear regression with scikit-learn on a real dataset. You can further explore the data, perform feature engineering, and try different machine learning algorithms for better performance.
