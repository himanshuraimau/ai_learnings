# What is ML?


Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed to do so. 

In essence, machine learning algorithms iteratively learn from data, identify patterns, and make data-driven predictions or decisions. There are several types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning, each suited for different types of tasks and data.


### **Types of Machine Learning**

1. **Supervised Learning**:
    - **Description**: Algorithms learn from labeled data, making predictions or decisions based on input-output pairs.
    - **Examples**:
        - **Classification**: Predicting whether an email is spam or not.
        - **Regression**: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, etc.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**:
    - **Description**: Algorithms learn patterns from unlabeled data without explicit supervision.
    - **Examples**:
        - **Clustering**: Grouping similar documents together in text analysis.
        - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features while retaining important information.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**:
    - **Description**: Agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
    - **Examples**:
        - **Game Playing**: Learning optimal strategies in games like chess or Go.
        - **Robotics**: Teaching robots to perform tasks by trial and error.



### **Key Terminology in Machine Learning**

1. **Features**:
    - **Description**: Features are individual measurable properties or characteristics of the data that are used as inputs for a machine learning model. They represent the variables or attributes that the model learns from to make predictions or decisions.
    - **Example**: In a dataset of houses, features could include attributes like size, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

2. **Labels**:
    - **Description**: Labels are the target outputs or values that the machine learning model aims to predict. In supervised learning, labels are provided in the training data and represent the correct answers or ground truth for the corresponding input data points.
    - **Example**: In a dataset of images, labels could indicate whether each image contains a cat or a dog.

3. **Training**:
    - **Description**: Training is the process of feeding data into a machine learning model and adjusting its internal parameters or weights to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual labels. The goal is to teach the model to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.
    - **Example**: Training a neural network on a dataset of handwritten digits to recognize and classify digits correctly.

4. **Testing**:
    - **Description**: Testing is the process of evaluating the performance of a trained machine learning model on a separate dataset that was not used during training. This helps assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data and provides an estimate of its performance in real-world scenarios.
    - **Example**: Splitting a dataset into training and testing sets, where the testing set is used to measure the model's accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
