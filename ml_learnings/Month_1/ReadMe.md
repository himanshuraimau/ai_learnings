### Month 1: Foundations of Machine Learning

### Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

- **Topics:**
    - What is Machine Learning?
    - Types of Machine Learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning
    - Key Terminology: Features, Labels, Training, Testing
- **Activities:**
    - Read introductory materials (e.g., Andrew Ngâ€™s Machine Learning course on Coursera)
    - Watch introductory videos
    - Set up your Python environment with necessary libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)

### Week 2: Linear Regression

- **Topics:**
    - Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
    - Cost Function and Gradient Descent
    - Evaluation Metrics: MSE, RMSE, R^2
- **Activities:**
    - Implement linear regression from scratch
    - Use scikit-learn to implement linear regression
    - Practice on datasets (e.g., Boston Housing Dataset)

### Week 3: Classification Algorithms

- **Topics:**
    - Logistic Regression
    - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
    - Decision Trees
- **Activities:**
    - Implement logistic regression and decision trees using scikit-learn
    - Work on classification datasets (e.g., Iris, Breast Cancer)

### Week 4: Advanced Classification Algorithms

- **Topics:**
    - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - Naive Bayes
- **Activities:**
    - Implement and compare these algorithms using scikit-learn
    - Practice with datasets (e.g., MNIST, Spam Detection)
